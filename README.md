## Usage Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Node.js v14.x or higher
- MongoDB v4.x or higher
- Expo CLI for mobile development
- React Native development environment setup

### Installation

#### Backend Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Update environment variables
# Edit .env with your MongoDB connection string and other configurations

# Seed the database with sample data
npm run seed

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the Expo development server
npm start
```

### Quick Start
1. Access the application using the following test credentials:
   ```
   Employee: 12345 | OTP: 1234
   Reviewer: 67890 | OTP: 1234
   ```

2. Submit your first idea:
   - Navigate to the "Submit" tab
   - Fill in the idea details across the multi-step form
   - Add supporting images if needed
   - Submit for review

3. Track your ideas:
   - Use the "Tracker" tab to monitor your submitted ideas
   - Filter ideas by status
   - View detailed feedback from reviewers

### More Detailed Examples
2. Viewing Statistics:
```javascript
// Get idea statistics
GET /api/ideas/stats
// Returns aggregated statistics by department, status, and benefit type
```

### Troubleshooting
1. Database Connection Issues
   - Error: "MongoDB Connection Failed"
   - Solution: 
     ```bash
     # Check MongoDB service status
     sudo service mongod status
     
     # Verify connection string in .env
     MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/kaizen-ideas
     ```

2. Authentication Issues
   - Error: "Invalid token"
   - Solution: Clear local storage and re-login
   ```javascript
   // In browser console or React Native
   await AsyncStorage.clear()
   ```

## Data Flow
The application follows a standard client-server architecture with RESTful API communication between the React Native frontend and Express backend.

```ascii
[Mobile Client] <--> [Express Server] <--> [MongoDB]
     |                     |                  |
User Interface    API & Business Logic    Data Storage
     |                     |                  |
Auth Context     JWT Authentication     User/Idea Data
```

Key component interactions:
1. User authentication via JWT tokens
2. Real-time idea status updates
3. Notification system for status changes
4. File upload for supporting documentation
5. Caching for improved performance
6. Role-based access control
7. Automated email notifications
8. Analytics and reporting pipeline
